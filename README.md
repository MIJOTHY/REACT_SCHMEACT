# REACT_SCHMEACT
A simple tutorial for simple people who want to use react.

## WIP

## Where do I go now?
Play around with react a bit more until you're comfortable with it, then head over to [my flux tutorial](https://github.com/MIJOTHY/FOR_FLUX_SAKE) if you feel so inclined.  
If you found this tutorial useful, ~~star it~~.
